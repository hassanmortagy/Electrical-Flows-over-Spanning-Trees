# Electrical Flows over Spanning Trees Code

---

## Introduction:
* The experiments we run for this paper were done on a high performance computing cluster where we ran all instances in parallel
* We provide all the raw data obtained from those experiements in the folders *Outputs_new* for our random instances and *Outputs_SPT* for adversarial instances, which could be obtained at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RHGIBrwkhXJaoU14EICokaeWlP4IxlMA?usp=sharing
* The code we present here contains all our baseline functions for all algorithms we propose in the paper as well some examples of their application to solve network reconfiguration problems
* Finally we also give the code to parse this raw data and use that code to generate some of plots and results presented in the paper for demonstration

## Requirements:
* This code requires all the data sets uploaded to be in the same directory as the code file
* This code also requires Gurobi (with a valid license) to be installed to the python environment used - this could be done at https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/quickstart_mac/the_grb_python_interface_f.html
